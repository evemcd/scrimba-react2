Challenge: Project setup

+ Create a `components` folder
+ Create the following components in separate files inside the components folder.  In each one, just render an `h1` 
  with the name of the component (e.g. return <h1>Navbar goes here</h1>):
    - Navbar
    - Main
+ Create an App component outside the components folder (sibling to the index.js file)
    - Have App render the Navbar and Main components
+ Import and render the App component inside of index.js using ReactDOM
    - At this point you should have your "Navbar goes here" etc. showing up
      in the mini-browser.
+ Go to Google fonts and get the "Inter" font with weights 400, 600, and 700.
  Put the links to those fonts ABOVE the style.css link in index.html (Use
  the `<link/>` elements instead of the @import or npm options for getting
  the fonts. You may need to do some extra research to figure out how this 
  works if you haven't done it before)
+ Complete the Navbar to match the design.
  Hint: use the Figma file for the most accurate peek at the design (colors, sizes, fonts, etc.)
+ Build the main section
+ Colour the bullets
- Place the gray react logo in the background
  Don't use an `img` element, but rather set it as the `background-image` of the `main` element.
  Hint: you'll need to use the following properties:
  - background-image
  - background-repeat
  - background-position
(Or the shorthand `background` property with values for all
those other properties)
